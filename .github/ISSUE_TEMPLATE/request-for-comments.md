# Summary
[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already available and you were teaching it to someone at Hudl. That generally means:

- Introducing new concepts or services.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how Hudl engineers should *think* about the feature, and how it should impact them. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide examples or migration guidance.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- For 3rd party solutions (buy not build): Do we have any experience of the product in Hudl or elsewhere?
- For 1st party solutions (build not buy): What lessons can we learn from what other communities have done here (Hudl or elsewhere)?

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons learnt elsewhere, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture.
If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

We want you to submit your proposal early to get feedback ASAP, we know that may mean there are unanswered questions with the proposal, add them here.

# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would
be and how it would affect web-stack platform and the wider Hudl community.
Also consider how this all fits into the roadmap for web-stack
and of the relevant team.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the
RFC you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities,
you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.
